I'm working alone so I can definitely certify that I am contributing to the project.

C14A-1 Test Changes:
- Both testTargetsNormal and testTargetsMixed had a test case that had the player location as a target.

- The change that I undid was because I was rereading the rules of the game and read something conflicting. Player movement
stops when they enter room but they must enter the room through a door. Since there are no door's in the experimental board, 
I thought having the player able to enter the single cell room was an error. Then I realized it wasn't when I double checked
with the previous assignment examples.
