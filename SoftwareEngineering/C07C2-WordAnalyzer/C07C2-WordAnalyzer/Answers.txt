1. The call to the java library occured on line 32 in the method firstRepeatedCharacter

2. I would fix the error by reducing the index in which the for loop stops at by one, specifically changing
"i < word.length()" to "i < word.length()-1". This is because the if statement that causes the error is
checking the character at the current index against the next index in the array. Which causes the loop
to index out of bounds of the word when it reaches the last index, and tries to check the next nonexistent
index.

3. During the first run adding the new line changed nothing, but after adding the command line instruction
to VM arguments the error changed to an assertion error in the constructor.

4. Yes it is correct

5. The index is 2 which is not what we expect, the expected
index of the first count increment is index 0.

6. The bug is that the loop starts at index 1 and only checks for repeats moving forward.
I would fix this bug by adding " || i == 0" to the inner if statement conditional.
