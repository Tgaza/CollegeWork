- Board.java
1. Renamed booardDimension, on line 9, to BOARD_DIMENSION to follow standard conventions for
constant variables, and fix the spelling error.
2. On lines 27 and 32 there is are newly created variables both called piece, which could
cause confusion at a glance. Therefore, I renamed them to redPiece and BlackPiece respectively
in order to prevent such confusion.
3. On line 12, the variable boardPiecesArrayList is excessively long and verbose, therefore I reduced it
to boardPieces.

- Piece.java

4. The Piece constructor was at the bottom of the class and so I moved it to the top.
5. Changed king and color variables to be private because it was only public so Tile could 
copy the draw method instead of calling it.
6. There is no comment describing the draw method in Piece, so I added a comment above to describe it.

- Tile.java

7. Setters and getters should be at the bottom of the class and the setPiece method is in
middle, therefore I moved it to the bottom.
8. Attributes should be placed at the top of the class and the global Piece variable is on
line 13, below the constructor, instead of at the top of the class. I moved it to the top
9. In the comment for the draw method, it states that it should call the draw method
from piece but instead it copy pasted it. I changed it so that it actually calls it.
10. Tile does not have header that describes the class at the top of the file. I added that header.
